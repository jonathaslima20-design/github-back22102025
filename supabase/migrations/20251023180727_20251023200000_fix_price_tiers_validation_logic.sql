  # Fix Price Tiers Validation Logic

  ## Problem
  The current trigger validation is failing because:
  1. After DELETE operations, it tries to validate products that may have no tiers left
  2. The validation logic is too strict and doesn't handle the DELETE case properly
  3. The trigger validates ALL products instead of only affected ones

  ## Solution
  1. Make the validation smarter to skip products with zero tiers after DELETE
  2. Only validate products that were actually affected by the operation
  3. Use temporary tables to track which products were modified

  ## Changes
  1. Drop existing trigger and function
  2. Create improved validation function that handles DELETE operations properly
  3. Create new trigger that only validates affected products
